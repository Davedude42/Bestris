# Bestris

I have a Samsung Smart Watch, and, at one point, I wanted to get some games for it. However, the app store for it was still fairly new and the games were very low quality. So, I decided to make a better one. I made a Tetris clone because itâ€™s fairly simple, and registered it on the app store in July of 2021, and it has since gotten over 23k downloads. I enjoy playing it and it has mostly good reviews. Its name comes from the fact that it is the best Tetris: Bestris.
